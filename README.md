# Diabetes-Prediction-using-EDA-and-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
This project aims to analyze and predict diabetes in patients using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a supervised machine learning algorithm â€” K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, widely used for binary classification problems.
